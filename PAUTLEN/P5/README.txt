Hello Laura.

I'm Santiago Atrio, team leader of the group and we write you
this really worried.

We dont know why but for some reason, the alfa file does not
executes if you dont executes it without valgrind.

We have tried nearly everything and nothing worked, we have even
tried to compile with other team makefiles, and none of it worked.

We really don't know how to fix this issue and we are really sorry
about that. We know the consecuences of failing this practice so 
please we beg you to have this into consideration when grading.

If you execute the program just like the makefile does with the
example file you will see that the program is running perfectly and
that the .asm file does work as it should, giveing the correct
output for every single example provided.

We are really sorry that this happened.

Sorry for the inconvenient. 

Sincerely, Santiago.
