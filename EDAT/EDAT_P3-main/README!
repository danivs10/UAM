This is a Tables & Index practice made in UAM by Daniel Varela Sanchez & Guillermo De Andres Perez, in order to use the code you must know the following commands:

1) "make -f Makefile.cod" this will compile the code and create the .o and executable files. 

2) "make -f Makefile.cod run" this will run the ./menu file showing the interface on the screen (you will see the instructions on how to use it in the interface, we added some extra commands to improve the experience)

3) "make -f Makefile.cod test" this will execute all the code tests (all of them must return OK)

4) "make -f Makefile.cod clean" this will only remove the .o files 

5) "make -f Makefile.cod cleanall" this will remove all the unnecessary files (Caution! .dat and .idx files included)
