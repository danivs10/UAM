MANUAL

In order to create and populate the database execute the command make all on the terminal (Important! classicmodels.sql file not included)
Once the database is created use 'make compile' on the terminal to create the executable menu file and the splint.log file which will check for errors. 
To execute the menu file just write ./menu on the terminal.
Now navigate the program using the numbers in your keyboard and pressing enter.
(Note: if you enter a null value nothing will be done unless in the find options where it will return all the possibilities that you can search for. We did that for in case the user doesn't know what he was looking for.)
In the customers submenu you can use the paging to navigate through the results. In case the results are greater that 10 you can use '<' and '>' to navigate through them.
